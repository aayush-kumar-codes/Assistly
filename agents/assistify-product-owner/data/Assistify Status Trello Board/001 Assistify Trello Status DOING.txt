### List Name: Doing

### Description

**Business Value**: Ensuring only authorized users see their assigned assistants enhances security and personalizes the user experience.

**Problem**: Users should only see assistants they are authorized to use, preventing unauthorized access.

**Description**: As a user, I want to see only the authorized assistants to make my experience personalized and secure. This is crucial for me as it ensures that I only interact with the assistants I'm supposed to, enhancing both security and user experience.

The tasks involved are crucial for the successful implementation of the system and include:

1. **Enhancing the backend endpoint to check user authorization before returning assistant information**:
   - Modify the existing `/api/assistants` endpoint to check user authorization.
   - Fetch the user's email from the authentication token and ensure that only assistants assigned to that email are returned.
2. **Storing user-assistant authorization details in MongoDB**:
   - Update the database schema to include authorization details for each user.
   - Store information on which assistants are assigned to which users.
   - Allow manual assignment of assistants to users for initial setup.
3. **Updating the frontend to handle different responses based on authorization**:
   - Adjust the frontend logic to appropriately handle cases where no assistants are authorized for the user.
   - Display a friendly message if the user has no authorized assistants.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

_Given_ the authorization details in MongoDB
_When_ the user logs in and accesses the dashboard
_Then_ they should see only the assistants they are authorized to use
