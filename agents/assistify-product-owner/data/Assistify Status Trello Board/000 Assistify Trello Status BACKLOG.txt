## Title: Integrate MontyDB for Local Development

### List Name: Backlog

### Labels

- persistence-nosql

### Description

**Business Value**: Simplifies the development and testing process by avoiding running a MongoDB instance locally, thus speeding up development cycles and improving testing efficiency.

**Problem**: Developers and testers must ensure MongoDB runs to execute unit tests, leading to potential setup issues and delays.

**Description**:

1. As a developer, I want to use MontyDB as an in-memory database to avoid the need to have MongoDB running during local development and unit testing.
2. This will involve updating the database connection logic to switch between MongoDB and MontyDB based on the environment (development or testing).
3. The solution should ensure a seamless transition without codebase disruptions, maintaining the current database operations and structure.
4. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   ```
   Given the application's database connection setup,
   When the environment is set to development or testing,
   Then MontyDB should be used as the in-memory database for all database operations without requiring a running MongoDB instance.
   ```

###### Tasks:

1. **Add MontyDB to Project Dependencies**:
   - Update the `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` file to include `montydb`.
2. **Modify Database Connection Logic**:
   - Update the `MongoDb.instance()` method to check the environment.
   - If in development or testing, connect to MontyDB instead of MongoDB.
3. **Update Environment Configuration**:
   - Introduce an environment variable to differentiate between production, development, and testing environments.
4. **Implement MontyDB Database Fixture for Testing**:
   - Modify the test configuration in `conftest.py` to use MontyDB as the database fixture for tests.
5. **Verify and Refactor Tests**:
   - Ensure existing unit tests pass with MontyDB.
   - Refactor any tests, if necessary, to accommodate the in-memory database.
